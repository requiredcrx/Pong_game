# Pong Game

This is a classic Pong game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics library. It's a two-player game where each player controls a paddle to hit the ball and prevent it from reaching their side of the screen. The game continues until one player reaches a certain score limit.

## Features

- Two-player gameplay
- Paddle controls:
  - Player on the right: Up and Down arrow keys
  - Player on the left: W and S keys
- Ball bouncing off paddles and walls
- Score tracking for both players
- Game reset when a player reaches the score limit

## Getting Started

To run the Pong game on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2. Install the required dependencies (Turtle graphics library).
3. Run the `pong.py` script to start the game.

## Gameplay

- Player on the right moves their paddle up and down using the Up and Down arrow keys.
- Player on the left moves their paddle up and down using the W and S keys.
- The ball will start moving, and players must hit the ball with their paddles to prevent it from reaching their side.
- The game continues until one player reaches a certain score limit (default: 5).
- When a player scores a point, the ball is reset, and the score is updated.
- The game ends when one player reaches the score limit, and the final score is displayed.
